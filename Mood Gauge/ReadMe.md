 **About:**
 
 This app has been created to gauge a user's mood over a period of time and to be able to track what was
 on the user's mind.
 
 When the user adds a mood a pin annotation is added to the "mood map" showing the user's location when the user
 added the mood.
 
 The pins will be colored according to the happiness level of the user which is set with a slider bar.
 
 The user can look at the "mood map" and determine where they were and what type of mood they tend to be in
 when they are in a different locations.
 
 **Currently Working**
 
 New moods are able to be added and will populate on the table view.
 
 **Needs Fixing**
 
 Added moods to be added to the moodmap as pins with different colored pins indicating the mood.
 Clicking on pins to show comment on mood and level of happiness
 
 **Added in the Future**
 
 Adding settings that will allow scheduled mood checks throughout the day
